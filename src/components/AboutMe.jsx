        Hi, I'm RaeSean White! I'm currently studying Fullstack Engineering and am in T5
        at Atlas School. I absolutely love working with Desktop Apps using different frameworks, and I find myself particularly drawn to
        learning languages to solve problems in the most proficient ways. After graduation, I'm hoping to relocate to Houston, Texas to pursue a job as a data anyalst and hope to eventully build a team to bring jobs to my hometown of Louisiana.
